# Personalized Health Monitoring for Mental Well-being

## Overview
The **Personalized Health Monitoring for Mental Well-being** project is an **IoT-enabled system** designed to monitor both physiological and environmental factors. By analyzing heart rate, SpO2, skin conductivity, and ambient temperature, it provides real-time insights into stress levels, offers **personalized wellness recommendations**, and facilitates **connections to mental health professionals** in emergencies.

---

## Features
- **üìä Real-Time Monitoring**: Collects and processes data from multiple sensors.
- **üí° Stress Analysis**: Combines heart rate and GSR data to estimate stress levels.
- **üéØ Personalized Recommendations**: Offers dynamic wellness tips to users.
- **üìà Data Visualization**: Interactive graphs powered by Kivy for real-time insights.
- **üìû Emergency Support**: Connects users to mental health resources.

## Architecture
### Key Components:
- **ESP32 Microcontroller**: Collects and transmits sensor data.
- **MAX30102**: Monitors heart rate and blood oxygen levels (SpO2).
- **GSR Sensor**: Measures skin conductivity to assess stress.
- **DS18B20**: Records ambient temperature.
- **ThingSpeak Integration**: Cloud storage for real-time data.
- **Kivy App**: Provides a sleek, user-friendly interface.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SwayamKohli/Personalized-Health-Monitoring-for-Mental-Well-being.git
cd Personalized-Health-Monitoring-for-Mental-Well-being
```

2. **Set Up the Backend**:
- Upload `backend.cpp` to your ESP32 device.
- Configure Wi-Fi credentials in the code.

3. **Set Up the Frontend**:
Ensure Python 3.x and the Kivy framework are installed:
  ```bash
pip install kivy requests
```

4. **Run the Application**:
```bash
python frontend.py
```
